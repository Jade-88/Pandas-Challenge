I can see that the schools wih a low overal budget have a higher percentage of students passing overall compared to schools with a high overall budget.
Also the schools with the most amount of students are on a medium percentage of passing overall. Which to me sounds like there isn't enough teachers to students ratio and maybe should consider downscaling students or getting the teachers to help the students get their grades up.
